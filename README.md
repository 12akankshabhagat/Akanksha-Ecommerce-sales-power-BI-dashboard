## Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI interactive dashboard for analyzing e-commerce sales data. The dashboard was created using data from two CSV files: `details.csv` and `orders.csv`. The primary objective of this project is to provide an interactive and user-friendly visualization of key sales metrics, enabling better decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can filter data dynamically using slicers for quarters and city names.
- **Data Integration**: Data from multiple tables (`details.csv` and `orders.csv`) was joined and connected to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- **Calculated Columns and Measures**: Custom calculations were implemented to manipulate data and derive insights.
- **Visualization Types**:
- waterfall chart for Profit & Loss.
- Stacked Bar Chart for Profit by Subcategory.
- Donut Chart for Payment Mode.
- Stacked Bar chart for State.
- Stacked column chart for Top 5 customer Name.
- Donut chart for Sum Of Quantity by Category.
